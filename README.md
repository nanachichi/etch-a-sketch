# Etch-A-Sketch

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

**Live** is [**here**](https://nanachichi.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

You can also erase by using right mouse button when in normal or "random" mode.  
I added the "Eraser" button so it's possible to erase on mobile devices.

What I **learned** by working on this project:
* Improved my **DOM manipulation** skills.
* Enhanced my **understanding of functions and event listeners**.
* Improved my **CSS styling** skills.
* Increased my understanding of the browser's **viewport**.
* Learned more about **responsive design**.
* Had fun!

I decided to make it **responsive** so it should look good on mobile devices.  
It's also compatible with both **Mozilla Firefox** and **Google Chrome** browsers.
